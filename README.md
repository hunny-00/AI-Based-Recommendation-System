*DESCRIPTION:*
ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project is an AI-based recommendation system built in Java using Apache Mahout, which is a powerful machine learning library. The system uses user-based collaborative filtering to recommend products or content based on user preferences.

This project is a great demonstration of how large-scale recommendation engines like those used by Netflix or Amazon work behind the scenes. It leverages Pearson correlation similarity, nearest neighbor technique, and Mahoutâ€™s recommender API to predict and suggest items to users.

It's ideal for those who want to understand data modeling, user-item interactions, and real-world AI-based personalization in Java.

ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
The system analyzes user ratings and finds other users with similar tastes.

Recommendations are generated based on what similar users liked.

âœ… 2. Apache Mahout Integration
Used Mahoutâ€™s GenericUserBasedRecommender, NearestNUserNeighborhood, and PearsonCorrelationSimilarity classes.

Clean and optimized code compatible with Java Maven projects.

âœ… 3. CSV Dataset Handling
Used dataset to read data from a structured .csv file (userId, itemId, rating).

Modular and easily replaceable dataset design.

âœ… 4. Clean Output and Explanation
For each user, system prints top N recommended items with score values.

Intelligently handled edge cases and exceptions.
